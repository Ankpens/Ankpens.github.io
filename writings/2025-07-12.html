      <p>Today,<br>
      the gods bathe not to cleanse,<br>
      but to remind us—<br>
      even the eternal touches earth,<br>
      even the infinite allows itself<br>
      to be held in ritual.</p>

      Balabhadra,<br>
      Subhadra—<br>
      not idols today,<br>
      but living presence.<br>
      They are brought down<br>
      from the golden seat,<br>
      step by step,<br>
      in rhythm with conches,<br>
      in the music of surrender.</p>

      <p>At the Snana Mandap,<br>
      the waters wait—<br>
      108 pots,<br>
      filled not just with water,<br>
      but with longing,<br>
      with the weight of generations<br>
      who believe<br>
      without question.</p>

      <p>The first drop falls—<br>
      and the heavens pause.<br>
      It is not just a bath,<br>
      it is a covenant.<br>
      Between divinity and devotion.<br>
      Between silence and song.</p>

      <p>This is no spectacle.<br>
      It is a lesson—<br>
      that the gods walk with us,<br>
      bathe with us,<br>
      suffer with us,<br>
      and rise again,<br>
      just as we must.</p>
