      <p><em>“Twenty days… my calendar says”</em></p>
      <p>But time is already folding in,<br>
      because with each breath I take,<br>
      you are already coming—<br>
      rolling closer<br>
      on wheels carved by centuries<br>
      and faith eternal.</p>

      <p>The drums will beat like the pulse of the earth,<br>
      ropes pulled by hands calloused with love,<br>
      the sky itself will bow<br>
      as you leave your sanctum<br>
      to meet your people—<br>
      no curtain, no threshold, no caste,<br>
      just devotion laid bare<br>
      like the open palms that pull your rath.</p>
